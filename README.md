The project you're describing involves creating a backend system that interacts with a third-party cloud vendor exclusively through APIs.

API Layer: This is the heart of the project, consisting of RESTful or GraphQL APIs that expose the functionality of the backend system to client applications. This layer handles client requests, processes them (e.g., CRUD operations), and returns responses in a standardized format such as JSON or XML.
